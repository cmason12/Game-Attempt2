# Game-Attempt2
Second attempt at game design. This version add drag and drop floor components, which you can add through the menu if visible. You can also left click on floor items to either change their properties or to delete them from the stage. 

I also allowed the player to be dragged by the mouse so I could setup senerios if needed for testing purposes but once the stage starts its disabled by default. I also implented a hitbox, the player doesnt actually collide with images rather the hitbox behind it which is slightly smaller. 

I also layed the framework to add more levels in the future, however there is only one stage at the present. The physics of the game are defined in each level so I can change them accordingly.
